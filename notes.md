# Notes
- [ ] Ask Nav if resistors in series is good practice
- [ ] Ask Nav to check circuit diagram
- [ ] Ask Nav about controlling 12v circuit with 5v + transistor
- [ ] Ask Nav about LM317T regulator design (If can't get 7805s)
- [ ] Ask Nav for supplies
	- Motor Driver
	- Barrel Plug
	- 7805s
	- 1.7K resistor
	- Switch
	- Breadboard? (Might be pushing it on this one)
